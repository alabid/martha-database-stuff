STEPS TO CLEAN UP ENERGY HISTORICAL DATA
========================================
1. Know what data we need into the database and what is right now in the 
   database.

2. Having identified the data (in spreadsheets) we need to put into the 
   database, we make loaders (python, PHP) to load the data in the 
   spreadsheets into the database living on 
   https://energdata.its.carleton.edu.

3. Build a matrix for the code we have.
   Information matrix.

4. User interface for data input into the database.

5. User interface for data output after the database.
