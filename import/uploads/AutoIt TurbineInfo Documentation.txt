The AutoIt script (turbineInfo.exe) can automatically collect data, store data into excel and call a python program to compile data.

--------------CONDITIONS of running this script:
;;; When writing this script, we assumed that VestasOnline shortcut, and excel shortcut are on the desktop.
;;; This script file, the python code and Hourly Wind Turbine Data.xlsx are in "My Documents".
;;; We also assumed that there are no files named current.txt, Hourly Wind Turbine Data.txt in "My Documents".
;;; If there are, please delete them before running this script.
;;; The excel version is 2007 Windows version.

-------------------WHAT TO DO IF THE SCRIPT STOPS RUNNING, but probably can finish:
;;; Can either treat this situation as failure and follow the steps for failure,
;;; or help the script to continue

-------------------How to help the script to continue if it stops:
;;; If it cannot dial up to the server, dial up manually.
;;; If it cannot save the excel file, save it manually. Choose yes when saving. Save data as txt.
;;; If it cannot close the excel file, (after saving), close it manually. Choose no when closing.
;;; If it stops after copy the data from VestasOnline software (does not open excel), click on command line window to make it active
;;; Other situations: Try to make the relevant windows active (software windows, command line window, and excel)
;;; If fail, please follow the steps for failure.

-------------------WHAT TO DO IF THE SCRIPT FAILS TO FINISH:
;;; 1. stop executing this script
;;; 2. delete current.txt, Hourly Wind Turbine Data.txt in "My Documents"
;;; 3. Rerun this script

--------------------Other notes
