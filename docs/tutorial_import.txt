================================================
1. Click on the "Ready to Upload" button on the left pane of the import facility import.php page.

2. After (1), the screen should appear as:
   (img -> ready_upload.jpg)
   
3. Choose the type of file you want to upload. Right now the system supports only these types of files:
   Wind Turbine #1
   Steam Plant Production Logs
   Electric Demand
   Weekly Electric Consumption
   (Siemens System) Campus Water Consumption
   (Siemens System) Campus Steam Consumption
   (Siemens System) Campus Electric Consumption
   - Wind Turbine #1
     -> Only Hourly Wind turbine data supported for now.
      An example is the 2011 Hourly Wind Turbine Data from the Wind Turbine #1 shown below:
      Filename: "2011 Hourly Wind Turbine Data.csv"

     (Include photo of Wind Turbine Data)

   - Steam Plant Production Logs
     -> The steam plant production logs contains information about steam, water, oil, and gas consumption
     in the Carleton College Facilities Steam Plant.
     An example is the Steam Production Log 2009 shown below:
     Filename: "Steam Plant Production Log 2009.xls"
     (include photo of steam plant production log for 2009)
     Then convert each worksheet in this ".xls" file to a tab-delimited ".txt" by using the "Save As" option.
     Also, collapse the spaces in the filename, so for example, "Steam Plant Production Log 2009.xls" will
     become "SteamPlantProductionLog2009.txt".
     This is how the file to be uploaded ("SteamPlantProductionLog2009.txt") should look like:
     (in Excel)
     (include photo of steam plant production log 2009 txt in excel)
     	      
     (in a text editor)
     (include photo of steam plant production log 2009 txt in a text editor like text wrangler)
     
   - Electric Demand
   (include elec_demand.jpg)

   - Weekly Electric Consumption
   (include weekly_electric.jpg here) 

   - (Siemens System) Campus Water Consumption
   Filename: "CAMPUS WATER.csv"
   (include campus_water.jpg here) 
      
   - (Siemens System) Campus Steam Consumption
   Filename: "CAMPUS STEAM.csv"
   (include campus_steam.jpg here)
   
   - (Siemens System) Campus Electric Consumption
   Filename: "CAMPUS ELECTRIC.csv"
   (include campus_electric.jpg here)
