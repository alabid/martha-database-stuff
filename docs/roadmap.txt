ROADMAP FOR MARTHA'S DATABASE WORK
==================================
CREATE A DATABASE SCHEMA ->
       FIND WAYS TO IMPORT THE TURBINE DATA IN EXCEL SHEETS INTO THE NEWLY
       CREATED DATABASE    
               		   ->
		FIND WAYS TO EXPORT THE DATA IN THE DATABASE INTO A RECOGNIZED
		AND PORTABLE FORMAT
		    	     ->
		 FIND WAYS TO VISUALIZE THE DATA EXPORTED FROM THE DATABASE
		 WE CREATED.

OPTIMIZE ALL THESE PROCESSES. MAKE SURE YOU USE AS FEW PACKAGES AS POSSIBLE
BUT STILL FAVOR ROBUSTNESS OVER COMPLEXITY WHILE STILL EDING TOWARD
SIMPLICITY.
