ALL WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE DATABASE AND ITS STRUCTURE
========================================================
Backup
------
We currently have two databases, "EnergyData" and "EnergyDataBackup". We try to keep both databases synchronized.
"EnergyData" database is the main production database we use.
On the other hand, "EnergyDataBackup" is the backup database we iterate upon during development.

SQL file backup file
--------------------
In the "sql" folder in "martha-database-stuff" repository, there is a .sql file (most likely named "EnergyData.sql"
that contains the DDL and DML sql of the database, "EnergyData."

In the future, we might put some more ".sql" files that are sql exports of individual tables in the "EnergyData"
database.

Schema
------
There are 17 tables in the database:
Address, building, BuildingHistory, BuildingType, Building_Room, CalendarType, City, DateObj, EnergyData (main table),
FuelType, FuelType_Supplier, History_BuildingType, MeterInfo, Supplier, Supplier_Address_Email, Supplier_Address_Phone,
Temperature.

A VISUAL representation of the database produced using Microsoft Access is in the "docs" folder in the repository; this
file is named "database schema-picture.pdf." (Note: This picture might not depict the most recent EnergyData 
database schema because it was made even before we implemented the database using MySQL software and before we
starting iterating over the initial design to accomodate new issues, ideas, and conveniences).
