DOCUMENTATION FOR WHAT WE'VE DONE SO FAR
========================================
1. We've an almost complete set of meters.
   We are trying to match the names of the buildings in the meter list with
   the names of the buildings in the database.
2. Then we'd go on to indentify more meters and match them with their 
   corresponding names.

Directory Structure 
===================
1. backups --
   This folder contains the most recent backup of the database in sql format.

2. MainSteam -
   This folder contains a txt folder which contains steam plant production
   logs converted from excel files to txt files.
   These logs run from 1996 through 2011. But only logs from 2008 through
   2011 are in the database.
   It also contains two .php files, putInDB.php and senddata.php.
   putInDB.php generates objects that contain the type of resource and the
   amount of the resource measured with other data like the supplierName of 
   the resource, the unit the resource is measured in, and the BTU Conversion
   of the measured resource.
   senddata.php is a pivotal .php file used to insert data from gotten from
   files like putInDB.php into the database.

3. docs -- contains all sorts of documentation.

4. for-jake -- directory that contains/ and will contain accumulated data
   that jake Reznick needs for his comps study.
   As of Wednesday, the 14th of December 2011, the folder for-jake/ has 
   output.csv that contains the different measurements of resources that Jake
   needs for his comps study. Some part of Jakes' comps study is focused on
   water consumption (Loop Water, Domestic Water, Tower Water); the file
   output.csv contains information about the usage of Loop Water, Domestic 
   Water, Make-up water, tower water, and remainder water (= Domestic water -
   loop water - make up water - tower water).

5. And others.
