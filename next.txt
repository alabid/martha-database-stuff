STEPS WE HAVE TO TAKE NEXT
==========================
No more database stuff, for now. Awww...
We had a meeting with Paula and Martha today and they said that we should first of all
get the data in one place and in one format because the data right now is in a mess and needs to be cleaned
up. After doing that, we can now start creating and even using the database.

1. We have converted all the xlsx files to txt.
2. We have a list of all the possible unique header names.
3. We could use this as a guide to make csv files that have a relation schema similar
   to the relation schema we have for the database schema we've already created.
   In other words, the behemoth csv or csv's that we'd end up with should be easy to pipe into the
   database. It should be in a good format and should be easily translatable.
