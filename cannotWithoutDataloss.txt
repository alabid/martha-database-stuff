THERE ARE SOME FILES THAT CANNOT BE INSERTED INTO THE DATABASE WITHOUT
LOSING SOME DATA. THOSE FILES SHOULD BE LABELED AS FOLLOWS:
if the filename is "daniel.xlsx"
It should be renamed to "daniel_ind.xlsx" -- stands for "daniel" + "independent" to
show that the data is independent of the other ones that will still be inserted
into the database.
