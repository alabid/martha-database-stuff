DOCUMENTATION FOR WHAT WE'VE DONE SO FAR
========================================
1. We've an almost complete set of meters.
   We are trying to match the names of the buildings in the meter list with
   the names of the buildings in the database.
2. Then we'd go on to indentify more meters and match them with their 
   corresponding names.

Directory Structure 
===================
1. backups --
   This folder contains the most recent backup of the database in sql format.
2. MainSteam -
   This folder contains a txt folder which contains steam plant production
   logs converted from excel files to txt files.
   These logs run from 1996 through 2011. But only 2008 through 2011 are in the
   database.
   It also contains two .php files, putInDB.php and senddata.php.
   putInDB.php generates objects that contain the type of resource and the
   amount of the resource measured with other data like the supplierName of 
   the resource, the unit the resource is measured in, and the BTU Conversion
   of the measured resource.
